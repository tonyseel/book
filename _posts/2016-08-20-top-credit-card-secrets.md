title: Credit Card Secrets
---

Much like other financial investment vehicles, credit cards have a bunch of "secrets" that the average consumer never learns to take advantage of - and the companies like it that way. Indeed; if more people knew about and used these; lending via credit as an institution would eventually cease to exist as the margins shrunk.

In the following, we'll uncover a handful of credit card secrets, so as to better position you to be able to take advantage of the many ins-and-outs of these ultra-competitive lenders. In just three tips, you'll learn how to utilize credit cards in ways you might have never thought of.

This may seem obvious. But the truth is, far too many people obtain credit cards that have rewards which don't really apply to their lifestyle. After all, if you hate the cold, then what good is it to get a trip to Moscow as an end-of-the-year reward?

With this in mind, when you get a card that provides you with frequent flyer miles; make sure you don't pay cash for things such as groceries, department store purchases or even gas - put it on your card!

Of course, in order to truly take advantage of this offer, you must avoid carrying a balance - head to your house and pay off the purchase right away. Then, the credit card companies don't get to take advantage of the interest, but still, of course, have to pay out the promised rewards and points.

Fact is; this only works out so well for them because the majority of people carry their credit balances from one month to the next. Many people every year take advantage of this and get free trips to Europe or Canada, etc, at the end of the season, for their entire family. You can truly rack up the frequent flyer miles with this disciplined approach.

All card companies love it when you carry a balance - this is, after all, how they make money. If everyone followed this tip, then the companies would have to close down because they'd go bankrupt and couldn't fund their operations.
